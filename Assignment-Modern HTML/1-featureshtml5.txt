Q1- List out the features of HTML5.

A-HTML5, the fifth version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here is a list of some key features of HTML5:

1. Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc., which provide a clearer structure and meaning to the content.

2. Audio and Video Support: HTML5 added native support for embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. It introduced the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, making multimedia playback more accessible and standardized.

3. Canvas: HTML5 includes the `<canvas>` element, which provides a drawing surface for dynamically generating graphics, animations, and interactive visualizations using JavaScript.

4. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 introduced support for SVG, allowing for the creation of high-quality, resolution-independent vector graphics directly within HTML documents.

5. Geolocation: HTML5 provides an API that allows websites to access a user's geographical location information, with their consent, enabling the development of location-based applications.

6. Offline Storage: HTML5 introduced several mechanisms for storing data offline, including the Local Storage and Session Storage APIs. This allows web applications to function even without an internet connection.

7. Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the concept of web workers, which are background scripts that can run independently of the main web page. They enable multitasking and improve performance by allowing complex tasks to be offloaded from the main thread.

8. Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the Web Storage API, which allows web applications to store larger amounts of structured data persistently on the client-side, overcoming the limitations of cookies.

9. Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduced several enhancements to web forms, including new input types (`<input type="date">`, `<input type="email">`, `<input type="number">`, etc.), validation attributes, and the `<datalist>` element.

10. Cross-Document Messaging: HTML5 introduced the `postMessage()` method, which allows secure communication between documents from different origins, enabling the development of more interactive and integrated web applications.

11. Drag and Drop: HTML5 introduced native support for drag and drop operations, making it easier to implement intuitive and interactive interfaces.

12. Improved Accessibility: HTML5 introduced new elements, attributes, and techniques that improve web accessibility, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret and navigate web content.

These are just some of the notable features introduced by HTML5. The standard continues to evolve, and new features and improvements are added with subsequent versions and browser updates.
