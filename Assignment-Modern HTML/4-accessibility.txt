Q4. List any 3 ways which helps us in improving accessibility of HTML.
A-Improving the accessibility of HTML involves making changes to the structure, design, and coding practices of your web pages. Here are three ways you can improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML: Semantic HTML involves utilizing the appropriate HTML elements to convey the structure and meaning of your content. By using elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`, you provide clearer and more meaningful structure to your content. This helps assistive technologies and users understand the organization of your web page and navigate it more easily.

2. Provide Alternative Text for Images: Images play an important role in web design, but they can be inaccessible to individuals with visual impairments. Adding alternative text (alt text) to your `<img>` tags allows screen readers to describe the content of the image to visually impaired users. Alt text should be concise, descriptive, and convey the essential information of the image.

3. Use ARIA Attributes: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes provide additional information and context to assistive technologies about the behavior and purpose of certain elements. By using ARIA attributes, you can enhance the accessibility of dynamic content, custom controls, and interactive elements that may not be fully accessible by default. For example, you can use attributes like `role`, `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby` to provide proper labeling and descriptions for elements.

It's important to note that improving accessibility goes beyond these three methods and requires a comprehensive approach. Other practices include ensuring proper color contrast, providing keyboard accessibility, designing responsive layouts, and testing with assistive technologies. Adhering to accessibility standards and guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), is crucial for creating inclusive and accessible HTML content.
